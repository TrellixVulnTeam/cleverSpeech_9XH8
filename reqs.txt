# this is 1.1 versions ahead of the  official DeepSpeech 0.4.1 requirements. It still works and we

# we have to use the CPU deepspeech package unless we go down the route of completely rebuilding the
# native client using the modified tensorflow v1.12.x sources, which I'm not too keen on just now...
# See here: https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/tree/v0.4.1/native_client
# Also... deepspeech-gpu v0.4.1 wants CUDA 9.x installed... But the TF 13.1 docker image is CUDA 10.
# Installing cuda 9 to /usr/local might fix this, but because we're only using this package during
# reporting (i.e. running inference to double check our results work against the package) so it
# should be okay to not worry about it for now.
