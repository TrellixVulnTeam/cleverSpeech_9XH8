# cleverSpeech

Classes/modules I use to generate adversarial examples for automatic speech recognition models in
tensorflow. Began as a modified version of [Carlini and Wagner's Attacks][0] against
[Mozilla STT][1].

Mainly used to prototype and evaluate attacks, so if you're looking for production ready code then
this is not the repo for you.

If you're looking for the experiments I've run as part of my PhD, then head over to the
[cleverSpeechExperiments](https://github.com/dijksterhuis/cleverSpeechExperiments) repo.

### Run the code
